## **Sagan Summer Workshop**

### 1) Theoretical sessions:
  
* Future prospects with direct imaging
* Fourier optics and fundamentals
* Coronagraphs
* Imaging
* Exoplanets Atmosphere studies
* Disk science
* PSF Substraction/Postprocessing
* Wavefront Sensing and Control

### 2) Practice sessions:
* HCIPY Handout: Optical Simulations of Coronagraphs, Pupil and focal plane grids creation, PSF and Apertures, Telescope Geometries.
* Imaging Exoplanets: We used a 3D cube image cube taken over time, then, we substract it stellar PSF and we get the position and brightness of a planet.
  Finally, we obtain SNR and we add fake filter planets to calibrate the real planets. We reduce with PyKLIP and measure calibrated flux of a planet with respect to it star.
* Basics on Optical Modeling: Mission Efficiency and Observation, how to apply models and other tools to verify what can we obtain from different observations related to exoplanets.

### 3) Group project and Presentation:
* Planet Masses Estimations: Using data of HR 8799 star with it planetary system a mass estimation was to be made. For that, a evolutionary model is used, which considers the isochrones and a the measure flux
  of our planet, we set a timescale and then proceed to obtain the absolute magnitude. This help us to interpolate the model and finally obtain a mass estimate.
